Hi There! My name is Clarence Costales, I am 20 years old from Bacoor Cavite City. I have Epilepsy since I was 3 months old and I take medicine until now.
Year 2018, I had experienced depression because I was feeling that any time I will explode because of overthinking and I was afraid that time that I might not passed my school
No one helps me to get out of that situation because I am theonly one who can help myselfm I tried so many ways for me to get better. I tried to be a someone who will listen and give advice to them.
When I was Senior High School, I was thinking if I will continue my College because of lack of financial. So after I decide I was looking for a job fair in social media and I see a lot of opportunities like Mcdo, Jollibee, and call center agent
and I pursue call center I always practice how to speak well in front of people and even in call. but I find it hard for me so I stop and tried to rest of finding a job
After a month, I tried again to find a job and my mom help me too. She find the site of Virtualahan and she reffer mwe to this to join so I try and when I started in Virtualahan I met Team 57 and it was happy to meet and know other people as well
but suddenly, a few weeks after, my laptop crashed and it did not open so I message Coach Josh and Tech Angela of what happened and I ask Coach Josh if I can continue my training and he agrees and now I am now Team 60 
Coach Anne will also know this story because she contacted me in messenger and she called me so I share with her what will happened and I am thankful that i can now continue learning in Virtualahan because at first I did not pursue or love digital skills like video editing , graphic design etc.
because it's not my passion but now I already love to learn more about digital skills and I want to master all sills.
